# Imagination in Translation:
An interactive experiment for studying the gap between semantic and visual representations in humans and AI

## Project Description
This project explores whether humans can accurately convey mental images to an AI using language alone. Participants will iteratively describe a ground-truth image to a Stable Diffusion model and try to improve the generated image through semantic refinement.

Our goal is to study the overlap between human semantic description and visual reconstruction in AI.

## Core Components
- Local Stable Diffusion for image generation
- Psyvhopy-based user interface
- VGG16-based visual similarity analysis
- JSON logging of all sessions and iterations

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
