# Imagination in translation
An interactive experiment for studying the gap between semantic and visual representations in humans and AI.

## Project Description
The project investigates whether humans can accurately convey mental images to an AI solely through language. Participants are asked to describe verbally a ground-truth image to a Stable Diffusion model, which then generates an image based on the description. After each generation, a VGG16-based visual similarity score is displayed alongside the subjective similarity assessment by the participants, who can either accept the generation (if they believe the similarity is sufficient) or refine their description and generate a new image. The number of refinement trials is limited to five for each ground truth image. It is not possible to use the same description twice without changes.

The data for all generation attempts (e.g., text descriptions, generated images, similarity scores) as well as the model parameters (e.g. seed) are logged for later analysis of language-to-vision alignment.

## Core Components
- Local Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo [model](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/Generate/paths/~1v2beta~1stable-image~1generate~1sd3/post) for image generation
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)-based user interface
- [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)-based visual similarity analysis
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) logging of all sessions and iterations

## Setup Instructions
1. Open the terminal.
2. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org-or-user>/Imagination_in_translation.git
cd Imagination_in_translation
````
3. Set up a Python virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate
````
4. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
````
5. Create manually a file called .env in the project root and add your Stability AI API key (do not share the key)
```bash
STABILITY_API_KEY= your_stability_ai_key_goes_here
```` 
6. Run the Streamlit app.
```bash
cd ui
streamlit run ui.py
````
