       "186  Frontal symmetrical view of an elegant outdoor fountain in a formal garden. The structure is built from pale beige limestone with a semicircular upper basin and a rounded projecting lip. A small central bubbler creates ripples while a smooth silky curtain of water spills over the front into a lower pool, forming white foam at the base. Behind the basin is a raised planter with a row of yellow flowers and a small shrub, backed by a curved stone wall. Tall dark cypress trees flank the scene, and white spherical lamps sit on square pedestals at the ends. A dense green ivy wall fills the background. In the foreground tan rectangular pavers form a neat geometric pattern. Soft even daylight, high detail, realistic texture, serene atmosphere, deep depth of field, no people.   \n",
