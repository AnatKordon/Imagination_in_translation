A modern glass conference table with pale green tint and crossed metal trestle legs sits centered, set with white notepads and black pens at each place, a clear water bottle and four small tumblers grouped in the middle. Surrounding it are carved dark wood balloon back chairs with turned legs and pink patterned upholstered seats. The room has cream walls above rich wood wainscoting, navy blue carpet, and two tall windows with wooden frames and venetian blinds showing leafy trees and a parked car outside. Ornate semicircular arches and a decorative column with painted floral capital rise from square wooden plinths between the windows. The coffered ceiling features detailed moldings and warm brass chandeliers with frosted globes, complemented by wall sconces, giving soft warm lighting with gentle reflections on the glass tabletop. Classic, tidy, formal, no people, realistic photography.  \n",
